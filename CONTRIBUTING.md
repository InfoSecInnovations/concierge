## Commit messages

Please make sure your commit messages convey which files or features have been modified while remaining concise. The user can view commit details to see exactly which changes were made, so it only needs to be a short overview to provide at-a-glance identification.

Additionally, the imperative style should be used. Rather than `added X, modified Y`, say `add X, modify Y`. A good way to remember this is "If applied, my commit willâ€¦"
