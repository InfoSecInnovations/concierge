# Request for the Ethical Use of Shabti AI


## Personal note

We recognise that the distributed and offline nature of Shabti means there is no practical way to monitor
the requests outlined below.  

However, we very politely make them, and will act as best we can to ensure they are followed.  

This is a very powerful framework. Please use it with care.  

Thanks,  
Mick Douglas  
Project Founder
