"""Integer settings read from the environment, with a default per name.

One dict rather than scattered `os.getenv` calls so the knobs are discoverable in one place and a
typo in a name is a `KeyError` at the call site instead of a silent default. Booleans keep the
`os.getenv(X) == "True"` idiom used elsewhere; only numbers live here.
