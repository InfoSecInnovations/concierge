    A plain function returning `relay(...)` rather than a generator of its own. `async for x in
    insert(...): yield x` would take the throw a cancellation delivers in *this* frame and leave
    `insert` suspended at its yield, so its rollback would never run and the partial document would
    be orphaned - which is the whole thing cooperative cancellation exists to prevent. `relay`
    forwards the throw into `insert` instead, and its `after` callback is where the log hangs off
    the end of the stream without adding another frame with the same problem.
