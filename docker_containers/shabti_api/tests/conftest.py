    An ingest runs on the server now, so a POST returns as soon as it is accepted and a test that
    asserted on documents straight afterwards would race it. Draining `GET /ingests/{id}` is the
    wait: the stream ends when the ingest does. A non-2xx is handed straight back undrained, so the
    tests asserting a 403 or a 404 still get what they expect.

    Both this and the follow-up listing rely on a finished ingest staying queryable - a small text
    file is done well before either request lands.
