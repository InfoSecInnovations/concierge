/**
 * Asking the right registry about each dependency, and judging the answer.
 *
 * A lookup that fails becomes a failed row rather than a failed run: a report on seventy dependencies
 * that omits one because a registry hiccuped is far more useful than no report, and it follows the
 * precedent the earlier prototype set, where an unreachable registry produced a warning rather than
 * aborting a release. `set` is the opposite case and does not use this - refusing to write is the safe
 * failure there, so it lets the error through.
