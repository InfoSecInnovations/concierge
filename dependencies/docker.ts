/**
 * Reading the image pins out of compose files and Dockerfiles.
 *
 * Compose files are parsed as YAML rather than scanned. That is what makes `image: null` - which
 * docker-compose-dev.yml uses twice to unset an inherited image and force a local build - a null rather
 * than a dependency named "null", what gives a service name to report against, and what stops the word
 * `image` inside docker-compose-uv-lock.yml's shell `command:` being read as one.
 *
 * Writing is a different matter, and deliberately never re-serialises: the compose files carry comments
 * that encode invariants, `${VAR:-default}` interpolations, and inconsistent trailing newlines, and
 * Biome does not format YAML so nothing would tidy the damage back up.
