/**
 * Rewrites every range pin as the exact version it currently resolves to, so the repo can move to exact
 * pins without changing anything that is installed today.
 *
 * bun ./dependencies/migrate.ts [--dry-run] [--no-lock] [--json]
 *
 * This is the one place in the tool that reads a lockfile, and only ever to answer "what is installed
 * right now". Everywhere else, reading one would mean reporting transitive dependencies, which is the
 * thing this must not do.
 *
 * A dependency whose occurrences resolve to different versions is reported and left alone. Picking one
 * for it would be choosing an upgrade for some file and a downgrade for another, which is a decision for
 * a person and for `set`.
 *
 * exceptions.json is honoured pin by pin rather than dependency by dependency, because pydantic floats
 * in the library that publishes it and is pinned in the app that installs it. An exempt occurrence is
 * dropped before anything is planned, so it cannot be written: an exact pin forced on a published
 * library is the one thing that file exists to prevent.
