/**
 * Sets third party dependencies to exact versions everywhere the repo pins them, then regenerates

 * bun ./dependencies/set.ts <name[@version]...> [--ecosystem <python|node|docker>] [--tag] [--no-lock] [--json]
 *
 * A version is never compared against the one already pinned: moving backwards out of a bad release is
 * as legitimate as moving forwards, so the only question asked is whether the version exists. That check
 * is against the registry's whole version list rather than a probe for the one version, which is what
 * lets `1.7` be accepted for `1.7.0` - the same version under PEP 440 - while the canonical spelling is
 * what gets written, and what lets a miss suggest what was meant instead. A name given without a
 * version is the one case where the version is chosen for you, and it is chosen from the same
 * `latestStable` the report prints, so `deps` and a bare name can never disagree.
 *
 * The whole list is one run rather than several: the working tree is read once, one HTTP client serves
 * every lookup, and the lockfiles are regenerated once at the end however many dependencies moved.
 * That makes the batch atomic for the reason a single dependency already was - every name resolved and
 * every edit planned before anything is written - so one unknown name writes nothing at all. Every
 * refusal is collected rather than the first one thrown, because three typos are worth hearing about in
 * one run rather than three.
